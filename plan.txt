page 1. home page, landing page, text based component -> renders text
page 2. create todo page, (form of some kind) -> todo
page 3. list new todos (new)
page 4. currently working on todos (in-progress)
page 5. completed todos

{
  todo-text: string,
  todo-notes: string,
  status: 'complete' / 'in-progress' / 'new'
}

1. inside app component:
we are going to have route (state)
using the nav buttons we are going to change the route state

2.
create 3 different types of todos in the app component, which we will update accordingly

3.
work inside the create todo page -> create todo form
create a todoText state so that every time input is change state gets updated
when onClick is clicked it will submit a newTodo **
we create a temp object
{
  text: string = todoText state inside the create todo form
  notes: string = ''
  status string = 'new'
  // when status is changed other possibilities: 'in-progress', 'completed'
}

// TODO **
// change the todos to be in one todolist, and at the top, filter and divide
// via the status, that way, we do not need to manually grab the currently editing todo
// and move them into different (buckets): todo_status lists(i.e: newTodos, inProgressTodos, and completedTodos)
